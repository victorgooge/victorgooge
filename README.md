## Hello! My name is Victor!! ðŸ‘‹

I am a full-time computer science student at Georgia State University and an aspiring software software engineer. I currently specialize in full-stack web and application development, with interests in data science, machine learning, and AI. 

I have experise and knowledge in a handful of languages/frameworks including:
  - Python, Java, C++
  - Javascript, Django, HTML, CSS
  - C/x86 Assembly/Unix
  - PostGreSQL/SQLite

I have a love for coding and problem solving, and often time enjoy my time solving leetcode. On my weekends I also like to work on my own personal projects. I'm always ready to learn, especially something new. As of right now, I'd really like to contribute to more open-source project and practice different types of development while I try to widen my skillset and internship opportunities.
